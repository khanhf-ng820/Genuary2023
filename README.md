## About GENUARY2023:

GENUARY returns! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It’s happening during the month of January 2023, and everybody is invited!

Over the 744 hours of January, for every 24 hours there will be one prompt for your code art.

You don’t have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y’know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium, on any planet.
